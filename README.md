# Gaussian Naive Bayes Implementation Using Python

This repository contains the implementation of the Gaussian Naive Bayes
classification algorithm using Python and scikit-learn.

## Project Overview
Naive Bayes is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm based on Bayes'
Theorem. Gaussian Naive Bayes assumes that features follow a normal
(Gaussian) distribution and is widely used for classification tasks.

This project demonstrates the complete workflow including:
- Data preprocessing
- Model training
- Prediction
- Performance evaluation

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Algorithm Used
- Gaussian Naive Bayes (sklearn.naive_bayes.GaussianNB)

## Steps Performed
1. Import libraries
2. Load dataset
3. Train-test split
4. Train GaussianNB model
5. Make predictions
6. Evaluate using accuracy and confusion matrix

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anshika135/gaussian-naive-bayes-implementation.git
